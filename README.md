# Language-Model

A Language Model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Given any sequence of words of length m, a language model assigns a probability P to the whole sequence. Language models generate probabilities by training on text corpora in one or many languages.

Language Model which refers to advanced AI models like GPT-3.5 developed by OpenAI. These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive. LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data and use deep learning techniques to learn patterns, context, and language structures. They can be used for various applications such as natural language processing, chatbots, language translation, text generation, and more. LLMs have the ability to understand and respond to complex queries, provide detailed information, and engage in conversations across a wide range of topics.
